# [Project 1: Classification of Fake and Real News from Filipino Sources Using Dense, LSTM and Convolutional Neural Networks](https://google.com)
* Trained a fake news classifier using a "Filipino Fake News Dataset"
* Used long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), densely-connected neural network (DNN), and a convolutional neral network (CNN) to perform a binary classification prediction of the news article.
* Evaluated the neural networks

# [Project 2: Modeling Economic Behaviour in the Car Industry using Agent-Based Techniques](https://google.com)
* Adapted an agent-based model to simulate a car market's consumers' purchasing behaviour
* Approximated the agents' individual characteristics through a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation obtained from datasets.
* Simulated the decoy effect
* Used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the results of the visualization
