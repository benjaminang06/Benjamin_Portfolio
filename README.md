# Benjamin's Coding Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Benjamin, an aspiring data scientist with a keen interest in applying innovative solutions to complex problems. Below are some of the projects I've worked on recently.
## Project Highlights

### [Project 1: Time Series Analysis and Forecasting using ARMA Models: A Case Study of the Philippine Stock Exchange](https://github.com/benjaminang06/TimeSeries)

**Objective:** Developed an ARMA model to predict future trends in the Philippine Stock Exchange Composite Index using historical data from 1987 to 2022.

**Key Results:** Identified the AR(1) model as the best fit with a MAPE of 6.62%, providing highly accurate forecasts. This model helps stakeholders make informed investment decisions by anticipating market movements.


### [Project 2: Insights from UAAP Basketball Data Through Topology](https://github.com/benjaminang06/Topological-Data-Analysis)

**Objective:** Leveraged Topological Data Analysis (TDA) using Giotto TDA to uncover unique player subgroups in UAAP basketball beyond traditional positions.

**Key Results:** Identified new player roles and strategies, offering novel insights for team management and tactical planning. Demonstrated the practical applications of TDA in sports analytics.
